POST: Used to send data to the server to create/update a resource. It is typically used when submitting forms or uploading files.
PUT: Used to send data to the server to update a resource. It is similar to POST but is used when the client wants to replace the entire resource.

HEAD: Similar to GET, but the server responds with only the headers and no body. It is used to check the headers of a resource without downloading the entire resource.
